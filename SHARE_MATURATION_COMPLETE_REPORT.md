## Technical Details

### Logic Used
The maturation process followed the existing established logic:

1. **Identification**: Found shares with `status = 'completed'` and `is_ready_to_sell = 0`
2. **Profit Calculation**: Applied trade period profit percentage (10% for 1-day period)
3. **Maturation Process**:
   - Set `is_ready_to_sell = 1`
   - Set `matured_at = current timestamp`
   - Calculated and stored `profit_share`
   - Updated `total_share_count` to include profit
4. **History Tracking**: Created `UserProfitHistory` records for audit trail
5. **Logging**: All actions properly logged for transparency

### Database Changes Made
- Updated 2 records in `user_shares` table
- Created 2 records in `user_profit_histories` table
- All changes committed within database transaction for safety
