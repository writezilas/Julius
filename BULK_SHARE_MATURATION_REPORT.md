## Maturation Process

### Logic Used
The script used the exact same logic as the existing `updateMaturedShareStatus()` helper function:

1. **Profit Calculation:** 
   - Formula: `(period.percentage / 100) * total_share_count`
   - Rate: 10% for 1-day period
   - Calculated: 11,000 profit shares

2. **Share Updates:**
   - Set `is_ready_to_sell = 1`
   - Set `matured_at = current timestamp`
   - Added profit to `profit_share` field
   - Updated `total_share_count` with original + profit
   - Cleared timer fields (`timer_paused = 0`, `timer_paused_at = NULL`)

3. **Profit History:**
   - Created `UserProfitHistory` record with 11,000 shares

4. **Audit Logging:**
   - Logged maturation event with full details for audit trail
