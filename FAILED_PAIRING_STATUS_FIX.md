## 🧐 **INVESTIGATION FINDINGS**

### **Trade Details**
- **Ticket**: AB-17584228697
- **Owner**: Daniel Wafula (User ID: 8)
- **Investment**: $90,000 (90,000 shares expected)
- **Available Shares**: 40,000
- **Trade**: Airtel Shares (0% earning)

### **Pairing Analysis**
**Pairing 1** (FAILED):
- Buyer: Maddy Power (AB-17584236783258)
- Buyer Status: **failed** (payment deadline expired)
- Paired Shares: 90,000
- Should be EXCLUDED from calculations

**Pairing 2** (ACTIVE):
- Buyer: Maddy Power (AB-17584237825038) 
- Buyer Status: **paired** (awaiting payment)
- Paired Shares: 50,000
- Should be COUNTED as "awaiting confirmation"

### **Problems Identified**

1. **Failed Buyer Shares Included**: The `getSoldSharePairingStats()` method was including pairings where the buyer share had status 'failed'

2. **Wrong Logic Priority**: The status check for available share count was happening BEFORE pairing checks, causing shares with available inventory to always show "Available"

---

## 🔧 **THE FIX**

### **1. Fixed getSoldSharePairingStats Method**

**Before**: Counted all pairings regardless of buyer share status
```php
$totalAmountPaired = UserSharePair::where('paired_user_share_id', $share->id)
    ->sum('share');
```

**After**: Excludes pairings where buyer share failed
```php
foreach ($sellerSidePairings as $pairing) {
    $buyerShare = UserShare::find($pairing->user_share_id);
    
    // Skip pairings where buyer share failed due to payment deadline expiry
    if (!$buyerShare || $buyerShare->status === 'failed') {
        continue;
    }
    
    // Only count valid pairings
    $totalAmountPaired += $pairing->share;
}
```

### **2. Fixed Status Logic Priority**

**Before**: Available share count checked first
```php
// This was checked FIRST, always returning "Available"
if ($share->total_share_count > 0 || $share->hold_quantity > 0) {
    return 'Available';
}

// Pairing logic never reached
if ($pairingStats['awaiting_confirmation'] > 0) {
    return 'Partially Paired';
}
```

**After**: Pairing checks have priority
```php
// PRIORITY 1: Check pairings FIRST
if ($pairingStats['awaiting_confirmation'] > 0) {
    if ($totalAmountPaired < $totalInvestmentPlusEarning) {
        return 'Partially Paired'; // ✅ Now correctly triggered
    }
}

// FALLBACK: Available count checked last
if ($share->total_share_count > 0 || $share->hold_quantity > 0) {
    return 'Available';
}
```

## ✅ **FIX VERIFICATION**

### **Before Fix**
- **Calculated Paired Amount**: 140,000 (included failed pairing)

- **Correct Logic**: ✅

### **Detailed Results**
```
📊 PAIRING STATS:
- Paid: 0
- Unpaid: 0
