# Support Form Visibility Feature

## Overview
This feature allows administrators to control the visibility of the support form on the user support page (`/support`). When disabled, users will still see the Telegram channel links but the form will be hidden with an informative message.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Database Configuration
- **Setting Key**: `support_form_enabled`
- **Default Value**: `1` (enabled)
- **Location**: `general_settings` table

### 2. Admin Controls

#### Dedicated Settings Page
- **Route**: `/admin/support-form-settings`
- **View**: `resources/views/admin-panel/settings/support-form.blade.php`
- **Controller**: `App\Http\Controllers\Admin\GeneralSettingController@supportFormSettings`

#### Quick Toggle on Support Page
- **Location**: Admin support page (`/admin/support`) header
- **Method**: AJAX toggle switch
- **Route**: `/admin/support/toggle-form` (POST)

### 3. User Experience

#### When Enabled (Default)
- Users see the full support page with Telegram links and the "Talk to Us" form
- Form submissions work normally

#### When Disabled
- Users see Telegram links as usual
- Form is replaced with an informative message: "Support Form Currently Unavailable"
- Message directs users to use Telegram channels

### 4. Files Modified/Created

#### Controllers
- `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/GeneralSettingController.php` - Added support form settings methods
- `app/Http/Controllers/HomeController.php` - Modified `supportNew()` method to pass setting
- `app/Http/Controllers/SupportController.php` - Added toggle method and setting to admin view

#### Views
- `resources/views/admin-panel/settings/support-form.blade.php` - New settings page
- `resources/views/admin-panel/communications/supports.blade.php` - Added toggle control
- `resources/views/user-panel/support-new.blade.php` - Added conditional form display

#### Routes
- `routes/web.php` - Added routes for settings page and toggle functionality

#### Database
- `database/seeders/GeneralSettingSeeder.php` - Added default setting

### 5. Permissions
The feature uses existing permission middleware patterns:
- `support-form-settings-view` - View settings page
- `support-form-settings-update` - Update settings

### 6. Usage

#### For Administrators
1. **Quick Toggle**: Go to `/admin/support` and use the toggle switch in the header
2. **Settings Page**: Navigate to `/admin/support-form-settings` for detailed control
3. **Default State**: Form is enabled by default for new installations

#### For Users
- No changes in URL or navigation
- Automatic adaptation based on admin setting
- Telegram links always remain accessible

### 7. Technical Notes
- Uses existing `get_gs_value()` helper function for consistency
- Graceful fallback to enabled state if setting doesn't exist
- AJAX toggle provides immediate feedback with toastr notifications
- Form validation and submission logic unchanged when enabled

### 8. Benefits
- **Temporary Maintenance**: Disable form during maintenance periods
- **Channel Preference**: Direct users to specific support channels
- **Load Management**: Reduce form submissions during high-traffic periods
- **Flexible Control**: Quick toggle for immediate changes
