# Payment Information Display Fix Summary

## 🚨 Problem Identified

On the sold shares view page (`http://127.0.0.1:8000/sold-shares/view/76049`), when user "maddyPower" submitted payment to "Johanna" (johana33), the payment confirmation modal was not clearly showing the buyer's information in a contextual way, making it confusing for the seller to understand whose payment they were reviewing.

### Issue Details

- **Trade:** AB-17584718053546 (Johanna's share being sold to maddyPower)
- **Problem:** Payment modal lacked clear buyer context
- **Confusion:** Seller couldn't easily identify which buyer's payment they were reviewing
- **Missing Info:** No clear display of buyer's profile information (MPESA name/number)

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. **Added Buyer Information Section**
Created a new prominent section in the payment confirmation modal that clearly displays:
- Buyer's full name
- Buyer's username  
- Buyer's MPESA name (from profile)
- Buyer's MPESA number (from profile)

### 2. **Enhanced Modal Structure**
Reorganized the payment modal with two distinct sections:
- **🔵 Buyer Information** (blue-tinted card showing who the buyer is)
- **💳 Payment Submitted Details** (showing what payment was submitted)

### 3. **Improved Messaging**
Updated status messages for better clarity:
- **Pending:** "The buyer has submitted payment details. Please review and confirm if the payment is correct."
- **Completed:** "You have confirmed the buyer's payment. The transaction is now complete."

### 4. **Contextual Modal Title**
Changed modal title from generic "Payment Confirmation Details" to specific "Payment from [Buyer Name]"

## 🔧 Technical Changes Made
