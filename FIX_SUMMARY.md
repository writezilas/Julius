# Display Logic Fix Summary: Trade AB-17584718053546

## 🚨 Problem Identified

Trade "AB-17584718053546" was showing as "Partially Paired" but the pairing details were not visible on the sold shares view page (`http://127.0.0.1:8000/sold-shares/view/76049`).

### Root Cause

The `shouldShowPairHistoryForSoldShare()` method in `UserShareController.php` had overly aggressive logic that was hiding **current selling activity** along with old buying history for shares that transitioned from bought to sold phase.

**Original problematic logic:**
```php
// If this is a purchased share that has matured and is ready to sell,
// do NOT show old pair history from the buying phase
if ($share->get_from === 'purchase' && $share->is_ready_to_sell == 1) {
    return false; // ❌ This hid ALL pairing info, including current sales!
}
```

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced Controller Logic**
- Added new `getPairingContextForSoldShare()` method that distinguishes between:
  - **Seller-side pairings** (current selling activity) - Always show these
  - **Buyer-side pairings** (historical buying activity) - Hide when appropriate to prevent confusion
  
- Updated `soldShareView()` method to pass detailed context to template

### 2. **Improved Template Logic**
- Modified `sold-share-view.blade.php` to handle mixed pairing types
- Added contextual messages based on pairing status
- Better user feedback for different scenarios

### 3. **Key Changes Made**

**File: `app/Http/Controllers/UserShareController.php`**
- ✅ Added `getPairingContextForSoldShare()` method with smart logic
- ✅ Updated `soldShareView()` to use new context
- ✅ Kept backward compatibility with legacy method

**File: `resources/views/user-panel/share/sold-share-view.blade.php`**  
- ✅ Enhanced pairing loading logic (lines 47-60)

- ✅ Accurate status messages (lines 503-527)
