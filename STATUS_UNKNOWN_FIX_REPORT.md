# Status Unknown Fix Report

## Issue Summary

**Problem:** Trade "AB-17584713427" was showing "Status Unknown" in the time remaining field after payment confirmation.

**Root Cause:** The `ShareStatusService` was missing a case for `'sold'` status in the `getSoldShareTimeRemaining()` method, causing shares with status `'sold'` to fall through to the default "Status unknown" message.

## Investigation Details

### Current Share State (AB-17584713427)
- **Share ID:** 76047
- **Status:** `sold` 
- **is_ready_to_sell:** 0
- **is_sold:** 1
- **total_share_count:** 0
- **hold_quantity:** 0
- **sold_quantity:** 110,000

### Problem Analysis
The share had successfully transitioned to `'sold'` status after payment confirmation, but the `ShareStatusService::getSoldShareTimeRemaining()` method only handled these statuses:
- `'paired'`
- `'completed'` 
- `'failed'`

Shares with `'sold'` status fell through to the default case, which returned:
```php
return [
    'text' => 'Status unknown',
    'class' => 'countdown-timer',
    'color' => '#95a5a6'
];
```

## Solution Implemented

### File Modified
`app/Services/ShareStatusService.php` - Line 641-648

### Code Change
Added a new case to handle `'sold'` status:

```php
case 'sold':
    // Shares that are fully sold - no timer needed
    return [
        'text' => 'All Shares Sold',
        'class' => 'countdown-timer sold',
        'color' => '#28a745'
    ];
```
