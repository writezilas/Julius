# Market Status Toggle - Popup Notifications Disabled

## Overview
The popup/alert notifications that appeared when enabling or disabling markets have been disabled to provide a smoother user experience.

## Changes Made

### 1. Market Index Page (`resources/views/admin-panel/markets/index.blade.php`)
- **Line 425-426**: Disabled success notification for market status updates
- **Line 433-434**: Disabled error notification for failed status updates  
- **Line 450-451**: Disabled error notification for network/server errors

### 2. Market Form Page (`resources/views/admin-panel/markets/form.blade.php`)
- **Line 380-381**: Disabled validation error notification for time conflicts
- **Line 387-388**: Disabled form submission notification

### 3. Mobile Test Page (`public/mobile-market-test.html`)
- **Line 429**: Added silent operation comment for test environment

## What Still Works
✅ Market status toggles still function normally  
✅ Visual feedback through badge color changes (Active/Inactive)  
✅ Loading animations and states  
✅ Haptic feedback on mobile devices  
✅ All backend functionality remains unchanged  
✅ Error handling and validation still work  

## What Changed
❌ No more popup alerts for successful status changes  
❌ No more popup alerts for validation errors  
❌ No more popup alerts for network errors  

## Backend Controller
The `MarketController::toggleStatus()` method still returns success/error messages in JSON format, but these are no longer displayed as popups in the frontend.

## Re-enabling Notifications (if needed)
To re-enable popup notifications, simply uncomment the `showNotification()` function calls that have been commented out in the JavaScript sections of the affected files.
